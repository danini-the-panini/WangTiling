WANG TILING!
============

This is an implementation of "Wang Tiling" in Java 2D.

Usage
-----

Run it (ant run, or through netbeans) and just drag an image file into the window, it's that easy!

Clicking in the window re-tiles (or randomises) the texture.

You will also find the following example tile-based textures:

  * test.png
  * seams.png
  * poe.png (this is from the game Path of Exile, see link in Notes)

Notes
-----

This implementation only supports two colours per axis and therefore only 16-tile textures. If you want to learn how to make your own texture, visit http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/55091, and if you want to know more about tile-based texture mapping, head to http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter12.html and also check out the references on that page.
