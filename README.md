WANG TILING!
============

This is an implementation of "Wang Tiling" in Java 2D. It's meant as an aid for texture artists to test their tile-based textures simply and easily.

Usage
-----

Run it (ant run, or through netbeans) and just drag an image file into the window, it's that easy!

Clicking on the window toggles visibility of coloured seams.

You will also find the following example tile-based textures:

  * test.png
  * seams.png
  * poe.png (this is from the game Path of Exile, see link in Notes)

Notes
-----

This implementation only supports two colours per axis and therefore only 16-tile textures. If you want to learn how to make your own texture, visit http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/55091, and if you want to know more about tile-based texture mapping, head to http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter12.html and also check out the references on that page.
